 China has taken its next step to overtake the US as the global superpower by launching the $50 billion Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The obvious aim of this bank, which will provide loans to developing Asian economies, including Pakistan, is to challenge US hegemony over the international lending system. The World Bank, IMF and Asian Development Bank are all, to various extents, controlled by the US. They give loans only with stringent strings attached, which usually have the effect of forcing the poor to pay back loans and interest which benefit the elite. In Pakistan we have seen how the IMF has forced increases in the price of electricity and gas as a condition for continuing loans and even tried to push through a substantial increase in the regressive general sales tax. The hope is that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank will provide more competition in the global lending market and give countries more bargaining power. Ideally this bank will not be ideologically committed to worsening economic inequality and funding massive projects of dubious value, all of which leave already poor countries bankrupt, with a huge portion of their budgets being spent just on debt servicing.

Such ventures are rarely launched for benevolent reasons and it may be in the ‘natural-social’ order of things for China – engaged in a power race against the US – to want to extend its influence in Asia and use the bank as a means. As we have seen with the massive influx of Chinese aid in our power sector, this money was only made available if Chinese companies were given operational and financial control of the projects. Labour rights and environmental concerns too cannot be expected to figure too much as China, like the US, is now firmly committed to neo-liberal economics, even if it is state-driven rather than left to an unregulated market. The US is already trying to throttle the bank by pressurising countries like Australia to stay away from it. As tempting as it might be to hail the bank just to poke the US in the eye, countries like us seeking loans from the bank once it is operational should not forget that all international lending institutions are driven to follow the same ruthless logic of interest – economic and geo-strategic. So the task before them should be to try and see to it that their interests too are served. This can happen only if and when they themselves have a vision of economic independence that rids them of the status of being helpless and desperate playthings of today’s economic powers.
