The inability of the government to collect Rs 145 billion Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) will become major bone of contention between Pakistan and IMF during upcoming review talks this week in Dubai.

 

The PML-N led government will also seek exemption from the IMF to calculate flood related expenditures from envisaged budget deficit target of 4.7 percent of GDP and the IMF is expected to grant its nod on this formal request. Pakistan’s technical team will leave for Dubai on Tuesday (tomorrow). Finance Minister Ishaq Dar will lead policy level talks with the IMF in Dubai after Ashura Moharram from November 5 to 7.

 

However, the sources said that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and his economic team is worried in the aftermath of legal irritants in the way of collecting GIDC amount of Rs145 billion as three High Courts including Lahore, Sindh and KPK had granted stay orders for barring the government to collect this tax imposed by the government through ordinance.

 

“The inability to collect Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) is a headache for the economic managers as they will have to present Plan B in front of IMF team of either taking additional measures to meet non tax revenue target or reducing expenditures of the same size to achieve the desired budget deficit target of the current fiscal year,” official sources told The News here on Sunday. The sources said that in case of government’s failure to collect GIDC then the government would be left with no other option but to take additional revenue measures to avoid slippages on fiscal framework or cut down expenditures of the same size. In the budget 2014-15, there is no space available to make adjustments of such a big size and the only option left is towards slashing down the development budget.

 

The government had allocated Rs540 billion in shape of Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) during the current fiscal year and so far utilized Rs50 billion during the first quarter (July-Sept) period of the current fiscal year. The government has set non tax revenue target of Rs816 billion in fiscal 2014-15 against revised estimates of Rs1,083 billion in last financial year. The sources also said that the IMF was expected to agree to put flood related expenditures into adjuster that would allow the authorities to spend funds without fear of breach of envisaged budget deficit target.

 

When this correspondent contacted the renowned economist Dr Ashfaque H Khan, who is currently Dean and Principle of NUST, said that if GIDC was not collected, the government would have to raise additional Rs145 billion to meet this shortfall in non tax revenues. “This is challenge for the government and any failure to raise additional revenues would breach the budget deficit target as agreed with the IMF. Another option is cutting down expenditures” he concluded.
