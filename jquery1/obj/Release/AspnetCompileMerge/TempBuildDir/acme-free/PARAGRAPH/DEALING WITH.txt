It is a truism of Pakistani politics that hardly any law is passed by parliament or promulgated by the government which does not, in one way or the other, benefit the ruling class or one of its influential members. Also, all existing laws are applied selectively and in such a way as to leave untouched – if not expand – the power, wealth and privileges of the ruling class.

Such are the iron rules of Pakistani democracy. The best-known example of this is the National Reconciliation Ordinance of 2007. Even after it was annulled by the Supreme Court, none of the big fish has been put behind bars or made to disgorge their ill-gotten wealth.

Similarly, for many years the provisions of the constitution which disqualify dual nationals from sitting in our legislatures remained unimplemented. Not only did some Pakistanis holding foreign nationality serve in parliament but a few like Umar Ghumman in the Musharraf regime and Rahman Malik during Zardari’s presidency even became ministers, despite a ruling by the Lahore High Court in 2002 in Ghumman’s case that dual nationals were disqualified for election. It was only after the Supreme Court’s judgement ten years later in September 2012 that dual nationals sitting in parliament were finally shown the door.

But even this judgement has not been implemented fully. First, there has been no action to enforce the court’s order that dual nationals who had been sitting in parliament should be prosecuted for the offence of ‘corrupt practice’ which carries a maximum punishment of three years’ imprisonment. Second, the ccourt’s order that these worthies should be made to return the allowances and other monetary benefits they drew while sitting in parliament has also not been enforced.

Far more serious than the failure of the authorities to take action against these fake members of our parliament are the repeated attempts, led by the PPP and MQM, to remove the constitutional ban on dual nationals from becoming members of our legislatures. The latest move in this direction was made by the MQM last Tuesday, when 16 MNAs belonging to the party introduced a bill in the National Assembly that, if passed, would not only make dual nationals eligible for election to parliament but also for the posts of president, prime minister and ministers, and retroactively nullify the judgement of the Supreme Court that expelled them from our legislative chambers. The government’s stance on the question is clear from the fact that it did not oppose the bill, which was then referred to the law committee of the house for further consideration.

Like the MQM, the PPP leadership has also been very active in trying to remove the bar on the election of dual nationals to parliament and has introduced legislation for this purpose. The ‘statement of objects and reasons’ attached to the MQM bill introduced last week has been taken largely from a bill presented to the National Assembly in July 2012 by Farook Naik, then law minister in the PPP-led government.

While the PPP and MQM have taken the lead in the campaign to open up membership of our legislatures to dual nationals, there is also considerable support for the measure in most of the other parties, including the PML-N and the PTI, although they have publicly been quite reticent on the issue. The reason is quite simple. There might be differences and rivalries among our political parties in the competition for political office and the patronage which comes with it, but they mostly agree that the power and privileges of the ruling class must be preserved and expanded. The possession of a foreign passport has become a cherished privilege that many of them aspire to.

When the Pakistan Citizenship Act was amended in 1972 to allow dual nationality with Britain and some other selected countries, the purpose was to enable Pakistanis who took up work abroad to acquire the nationality of their country of employment so as to enjoy the rights and benefits of citizenship in that country, while at the same time retaining the freedom to travel to and reside in Pakistan and to carry on business and to own and transfer property in the country. The object was not to give our ruling class the option of acquiring dual nationality while enjoying full freedom to milk their own country. It is obvious that a law which was intended to benefit ordinary Pakistanis has been turned on its head and perverted by our ‘elite’ for their own advantage. This must not be allowed.

The constitution, including the ban on dual nationals holding elective office, was passed after the amendment in the citizenship law to allow dual nationality. It is, therefore, safe to assume that the framers of the constitution took a deliberate and well-considered decision to exclude dual nationals from parliament and high public office. The main factor in their mind was no doubt that those Pakistanis who pledge allegiance to another country cannot be expected to give their undivided loyalty to Pakistan and should not, therefore, be entrusted with public office or with positions in which public policy is decided.

That consideration remains as compelling now as it was when the constitution was adopted in 1973. But there is perhaps another, better, way today to strike a balance between the two opposing demands of giving the overseas Pakistan as many of the rights of citizenship as possible, but excluding them from elective and public office. This could be done by abolishing dual nationality but giving people of Pakistani origin, up to two generations, the rights to take up residence and private sector employment, do business and own property in the country. A special identity document, something like the Pakistan Origin Card, could be issued to the entitled persons. All this could be done through an amendment in the Pakistan Citizenship Act and the ordinary law and would not require a constitutional amendment.

Our citizenship law also needs to be updated in other ways, two in particular.

First, the conditions for the acquisition of citizenship by birth in the country should be redefined. At present, every person born in Pakistan, even of foreign parents, becomes a citizen. Britain also had a similar law until 1981. In that year, a new law was passed under which a person born in the country becomes a British citizen only if at least one of his parents is a British citizen. India made a similar change in its law in 1987. Pakistan should also make it a condition for acquisition of citizenship that one of the parents of a person born in Pakistan is a Pakistani. This is necessary to ensure that only those with genuine links to the country become our citizens.

Second, women should be placed fully at par with men both as regards their ability to pass citizenship to their children and the acquisition of citizenship by their spouses. A partial step in this direction was taken through an amendment of the Pakistan Citizenship Act in 2000. Before this amendment, a person born outside Pakistan became a citizen if, at the time of his birth, his father was a Pakistani. Now a person born outside Pakistan acquires the country’s citizenship if his ‘parent’ (sic), ie one of his parents, whether father or mother, was a Pakistani at the time.

While women can now pass citizenship to their children in the same way as men, they are still discriminated against in the acquisition of citizenship by their husbands. The foreign husband of a Pakistani woman cannot acquire Pakistani citizenship by registration, while the foreign wife of a Pakistani man can. In 2007, the Federal Shariat Court held this discrimination to be unconstitutional. The matter is now before the Supreme Court. This differentiation between men and women must be stopped either by ending the acquisition of citizenship by foreign wives through registration, or by providing for the same procedure for foreign husbands, preferably the latter, but with a mandatory requirement of a minimum period of residence in the country for both genders.
