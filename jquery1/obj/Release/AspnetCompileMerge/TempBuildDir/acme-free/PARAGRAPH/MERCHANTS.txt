When values of shares of the corporations that manufacture military arsenal soar, it means the companies are doing brisk business. Lockheed Martin grew by 43 percent and General Dynamics by 41 percent in one year.

Besides producing a wide range of military hardware, Lockheed Martin produces Hellfire missiles for pilotless drones. Hasn’t warring become the most lucrative business as long as its victims are thousands of miles away and their shrieks are not heard back home?

The US has been at war continually since the Second World War. Starting from Korea and Vietnam to the present wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, it’s an unending military adventure. Does the economy of the superpower depend on wars? If that’s so, then how can we expect peace in the world?

Would Lockheed Martin or General Atomics – manufacturers of Predator and Reaper drones – want the wars to end? Never! The Military Industrial Complex, a term that President Eisenhower coined and cautioned the American nation against, has been dominating the US’ foreign and defence policies.

Whenever a military campaign loses steam, another one begins. There’s never a lull in this. A few months ago, the US wanted to topple President Bashar al-Assad from power in Syria, but now the superpower is launching air attacks against his opponents – Isis. Possibly Isis is the natural outcome of the imperial occupation of Iraq in which more than 1.5 million Iraqis lost their lives.

The treacherous part of the wars in the Arab world is that Muslim territories are the arena of destruction, Muslims the victims, western weapons the means of annihilation, and petrodollars the source of funding. There couldn’t be a better proposition for the west.

The US maintains more than a thousand military bases globally. It has maintained bases in the UK for the last 70 years. Seumas Milne, in his article in the Guardian, ‘70 years of foreign troops? We should close the bases’ (Jan 23, 2014), wrote: “It's almost never discussed in the political mainstream. But thousands of foreign troops have now been stationed in Britain for more than 70 years...They arrived in 1942 to fight Nazi Germany but they didn't head home in 1945”. Wonder what would have been the future of such bases if Scotland had parted company with the UK.

Nevertheless, two recent events in Canada, one the killing of a soldier on guard duty at the National War Memorial followed by a shootout near the parliament building, and the other of a mentally disturbed driver killing a soldier by running him over, shocked the Canadian government.

Shocked at what? Hasn’t Canada been at war for 13 long years and has had its troops as part of the coalition forces to participate in the wars of aggression against defenceless countries? Why should it not expect blowback, however insignificant in size? Aren’t large Muslim populations that have faced death and destruction angry?

William Rivers Pitt was a weapons inspector in Iraq who declared that the country did not possess any weapons of mass destruction. Yet the imperial powers attacked Iraq. In his recent article, he explains what blowback is:

“...let me introduce you to the concept of ‘blowback,’ another way of saying that a nation reaps what it sows, which basically means that when you punch someone in the face, odds are very good that you're going to get punched back, and maybe they land that counterpunch, or maybe they don't, but that fist is going to come whistling at your face, count on it, and if it misses, there is always another fist, curled and hard and ready to fly...”

However, it is surprising that not as many writers, social and political activists, protest against the pain and suffering inflicted by the imperial wars in their countries as the western writers and activists do without suffering. We must owe this much to them.
