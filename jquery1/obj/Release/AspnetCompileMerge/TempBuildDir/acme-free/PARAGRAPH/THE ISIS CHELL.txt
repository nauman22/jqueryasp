The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (Isis), also known as al-Dawlah al-Islamiyah in al Iraq wal Shâm (DAISH), declared a transnational geographical state as its caliphate on June 29. In Pakistan many analysts claim that the local militant and extremist groups may easily embrace the Isis philosophy given the country’s alleged ‘fertile ground’ for such forces.

These analysts refer to the various TTP and Al-Qaeda splinter groups, which aspire to have a Shariah-based state, as Isis’ likely recruits. They cite the recent announcement of the allegiance to Isis by TTP spokesperson Shahidullah Shahid and five other commanders as an affirmative sign of this conjecture.

For them, the appearance of a pamphlet titled ‘Fatah’ some weeks ago in Peshawar testifies that Isis is active in Pakistan. They observe that the message of Isis may attract at least relatively a more conservative population in Fata, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and southern Punjab.

However, these experts tend to ignore the fact that the media savvy Isis has been effectively reaching out to a targeted population worldwide, including Pakistan, through the internet. Fortunately, Isis’ efforts have not yet yielded big results. Mullah Omar chose not to abdicate in favour of Al Baghdadi. His faction still wants him to be Afghanistan’s caliph. Though pleased with the Isis victories, the TTP stalwarts have not announced support for the so-called Isis caliphate.

In comparison to what has happened in Europe and Asia Pacific, support in Pakistan is muted despite the fact that Isis has announced establishment of its chapter for Afghanistan and India. No open rallies have been held in its favour in Pakistan. Also, there are no credible reports that Pakistani youngsters have flown to Isis territories to join its fighters.

Can Isis possibly target the religious youth in Pakistan? For recruitment, our backward rural areas and religious radicals may offer some possibilities. For political support, the Isis may try to enlist our conservative educated or semi-educated urban youth. Here, Isis’ success or failure depends on the country’s economic performance and its ability to address various pressing issues.

Limited political support could be available to Isis through rhetoric and websites. But individuals wanting to join the Isis fighters will find it difficult to travel to its strongholds.

So should we stop worrying on account of Isis, treat it as an Arab issue and let the west and the US fight their self-declared worst enemy? Not really. Isis may not get a large number of recruits and much political support from Pakistan, but its message has the potential to wean away many Pakistanis from the mainstream.

In rural areas, it would reflect in the form of opposition to women’s education and human rights, increased religious discrimination and more sectarian conflicts. There will be more pamphlets, CDs and wall chalking, sermons etc in favour of Islamic causes including Isis. In urban areas, religious parties are likely to draw bigger crowds in their political rallies.

The situation is not likely to change drastically even if the Taliban gain an upper hand in the power game in Afghanistan after the drawdown of the US/Nato forces. Personal preferences and vested interests involving commercial and political gains will cause realignments and readjustments in the strategy of small TTP and Afghan Taliban factions.

Operation Zarb-e-Azb has disrupted the terrorists’ network in North Waziristan and contributed to the destruction of prospective Isisallies. The disturbing fact, however, is that this operation commenced after too much delay and with too much publicity.

Many terrorists and radicals had already slipped into Afghanistan and the neighbouring Central Asian Republics before the start of the operation. Some of them might hold sympathy for Isis. These militants may try to return to Afghanistan or Pakistan and will pose a threat to the democratic forces. They may even exercise a marginal influence on Islamic militants in India and China, which now seem to be more determined to act decisively against extremist elements. Pakistan has to be more watchful not to let its territory be used against its neighbours.

Pakistan may have been a hotbed of the Taliban and a testing ground for proxy wars. But it is wrong to presume that it will become a breeding ground for Isis. An Islamic caliphate is not the preferred aspiration of Muslims in South Asia.

The idea of caliphate died with the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. A very small minority in Pakistan continues to adhere to it. Even among the religious parties support for this cause is weak. If we look at our history, nationalism has triumphed over traditions such as a caliphate. This concept will find hardly a few takers in Pakistan.

However, we cannot afford to lower our guard against those Taliban commanders who have announced allegiance to the self-proclaimed caliph of the Islamic State. These commanders may continue to enjoy some support among the TTP and may feel tempted to stage some big terrorist activity in Pakistan. Therefore, Pakistan and Afghanistan need to jointly work against this common enemy.

How to sustain the weak and fractured cooperation will be a big challenge for the government in Islamabad and a tricky mosaic for its intelligence agencies. Hungary and Romania offer a workable model of consultation and cooperation. Both their governments hold combined sessions of their full cabinets twice a year to discuss and resolve discordant issues. The decisions are later endorsed by their national cabinets to give a constitutional cover for implementation. A similar mechanism has been adopted by Indonesia which holds annual joint cabinet meetings with Australia, Malaysia and Singapore.

Pakistan continues to have security problems on an immense scale. It will have to remain extra vigilant. Its security agencies should not lower their guard against Isis sympathisers. It should watch over new realignments among militant factions, both indigenous and foreign. The TTP has obviously received a serious blow. Its network has been disrupted. But that does not mean that the TTP has lost the capability and the will to regroup and strike back. Pakistan will have to keep the army in Fata for a long time to ensure peace and stability.

More than commanders, affiliations and ideological differences are important to understand the future scenario and deal with it. The role of US and Nato forces is likely to remain critically important despite their reduced size in the post-2014 drawdown from Afghanistan. Along with bilateral cooperation with Afghanistan, Pakistan should continue with trilateral mechanism involving the US and the west.

It is a welcome development that the prime minister has paid a visit to Miranshah and vowed to ensure development in the region. He said roads will be built and towns will be developed in the area. Perhaps, the government will have to do more than build roads and towns. Fata has to be given its due stake in a democratic Pakistan.

If we want to charter a new Pakistan, we must ensure good governance and equitable distribution of development for all regions in the country. Half-measures will not bring change. Any inaction or insufficient action is likely to provide the currently fractured terrorists the much needed space to grow and bolster their influence. The pot is still simmering. The government should not wait for it to boil.
