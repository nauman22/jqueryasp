Opposition leader Syed Khursheed Shah’s comments on PTI politics, ‘its demands are justified but strategy to achieve objectives is wrong, suggesting it should revert to the Parliament.’ The decision of the PTI Core Committee yesterday directing its MNAs to appear before the Speaker of National Assembly together instead of individually for the acceptance of their resignations seems a conscious attempt to attract maximum media attention without tangible outcome. The Core Committee should have allowed PTI MNAs to appear before the Speaker as per the Rules of Business if it did not truly want to remain part of the Parliament. Why shade of misunderstanding? It suggested, the PTI might not seek the resignations to be accepted by the Speaker after all and instead was contemplating to keep the cauldron boiling for the sake of gaining political mileage unabatedly. It is good news and bad news at the same time, because this course of action points to the rethinking of PTI in favour of keeping the option open for unforeseeable future. The bad news is of PTI’s determination to continue to tread on the trajectory of politics of confrontation on pro-active basis.

 

There is sense in the decision of the PTI Core Committee as the party did not want to leave the field of Parliament open for its political opponents when seen in the context of recently held joint session of Parliament. The session effectively took the thunder out of the sails of both PTI and the PAT by turning the tables against them. PTI’s point of view would also become the victim of default in the Parliament with their absence. By remaining in the Parliament, the PTI can mount maximum pressure on the incumbent government both internally by using parliamentary forum, and externally by mass mobilization through holding rallies in the country. Imran Khan’s warning to PTI parliamentarians of throwing anyone out of the party fold who wades to follow independent action also substantiates to the view of his not leaving the Parliament. He does not want the resignations to be accepted by the Speaker on the pretext of PTI not following the Rules of Business in letter and spirit.

 

Dr Tahirul Qadri ‘ his cousin brother of sit-in’ had been crying horse for the last many weeks for the dreamy ‘revolution’ to his fanatic audiences of sit-in in Islamabad. His highly misplaced contempt for assemblies and the platitudes of Nawaz Sharif government’s acute vulnerability were hardly convincing. He gave dates of the packing up of the government and the Parliament predicting the dawn of his revolution that would usher in an era of canals of milk and honey flowing in the country and no one would starve to death or want of medical treatment. No one would be without shelter, clothing, food and job; poverty would be the bitter thing of the past. His clamouring of not going back without the revolution, even heaven may fall, had exposed his politics to the bare knuckle. He warned his workers to stay put in dharna with instructions to his other followers to kill any one who decided to make a volte face to his supreme cause. His making of volte face, as such, should trigger piercing questions as why he has backed out?

 

Dr Tahirul Qadri, apparent road map was to inflict paralysis on the government’s writ. For this, his followers made impossible for the judges of the Supreme Court to reach the court through the designated route. The parliamentarians had to go to the Parliament to attend the session through the unidentified route. They ransacked the PTV building and suspended the transmission for a short period of time. They blocked the entry of civil servants into the Pak Secretariat. They physically tortured the senior officers of the law enforcement agencies with staves. Leader of PAT instead of condemning the despicable conduct of the workers used to boast their stupidity as the comradeship paving the way of the surreal revolution. The government was not visible in the capital as the law of the land was being trampled upon by the protestors without an iota of fear of legal consequences. The conspiracy theories were abounding in the capital of the raising of the finger by the “Umpire.” His existence was confidently denied by Asif Ali Zardari. He said, no one will come to their rescue. His (Dr Qadri) sudden calling off the day exposed the frailty of the “script” to the core because it did not delineate between the climax and anti-climax as such the drop scene optimized the flip- flop of the whole drama.

 

The political analysts are of the opinion that he would not turn up again to this style of politics because of the fear of meeting the inevitable fate of an exercise in futility. His announcement yesterday of going aboard for fund raising points to his unlikely early returns. His sit-in spread over more than two months could not bring desired results and this very fact would be enough to discourage him and his followers to think before they take plunge in the visionless, ill conceived and beaten track of politics. If the Model Town incident was the height of administrative inaptness of the Punjab government then the decision of Dr Qadri was the manifestation of invincibility of prudence and the maturity of the country’s politics. He made women and children to suffer the discomforts of living away from their homes for such a longer period of time. They must put question to themselves as why they were following him blindly who used them as a fodder for his melodrama that was apparently sponsored by those who wanted to settle scores with this government. Or, those who wanted to get certain concessions by generating pressure against government using PAT as proxy. As the patrons had been obliged by the government so they left the PAT leader and his followers high and dry to face the humiliation.

 

The followers, both men and women, were made subject of ridicule when they wore shroud posturing to force the revolution of their leader. It was a sheer humbug attempt of capitulation that could not be justified by any criterion. What sort of image of the country and the civil society had been perceived by the international community that was watching the Tamasha with sense of shock and contempt. This presentation of Talibnisation in politics was equally contemptible because their insistence to dissolve the government was an unconstitutional demand ‘at gun point’ Dr Qadri was indulging in open defiance of the Constitution, if proved, it is the highest crime.

 

Pakistan People’s Party, being a matured and experienced political party, had opposed PAT and PTI tactics as against the democratic government and indeed against democracy. The PPP could not stand this juggernaut because it had, throughout its history, struggled in the face of ferocious dictatorships, shed the blood of its leaders and workers to nurture democracy. Secondly, the PPP accepted the results of May 2013 elections despite the serious reservations only for the sake of the continuity of the political system in the country. The party had invested heavily in the political system and as such could not afford the heist of its hard earned capital. Thirdly, PPP joining the bandwagon of those who were vociferously questioning the impartiality of the elections would have surely led to the derailment of democracy in the country. PPP leadership was not at all prepared to pay such a high price of abandoning the cause that it cherished throughout and had been earnestly espousing the same as the invaluable legacy of its leaders. It firmly held its grounds and threw its full political weight behind democracy to the utter frustration of others.

 

PPP has played a decisive and positive role throughout the sit-in politics by extending unequivocal support to democracy, and the government of the day also felt less vulnerable as a consequence. The PPP had to imbibe the allegations of “B team” of the government but it cared less of such allegations and remained steadfast to the disappointment of those who were conspiring to make a kill. PPP has stood like rock in the face of the approaching black tide. The calling of the joint session of the Parliament on the advice of the PPP leaders turned the table in favour of democracy. The government also took a sigh of relief which was under great pressure generated by PTI and PAT. They were hand in gloves against the government and indeed against democracy. Former President Asif Ali Zardari’s timely initiatives of meeting the prime minister twice had put cold water on their insidious designs of any one against the government and the Constitution. His meetings with the prime minister in quick succession was an expression of his total solidarity with the Constitution urging the democratic forces to get united and stand up against those who were hell bound to hurt democracy and the Constitution. His distress call made the difference and the government was on firm footing that had been dealing the political situation with sweaty hands and heavy feet.
