ISLAMABAD: Not only are there different laws for the rulers and the ruled, discriminatory treatment is also given in sharing ‘official truths’ as the government offers different answers to the same questions depending on whether the questioner is from the public or political elite.

 

The Privatisation Commission is the latest example in this respect that has been caught while replying to a Right to Information (RTI) request about 167 public sector entities privatised since 1991.

 

Responding to one query alone inquiring whether any post-privatisation mechanism exists to oversee the implementation of terms and conditions signed between the government and buyers, the RTI request was refused answer on the ground that it was secret information. A senator who submitted the same question through the Senate Secretariat was told that as a matter of fact no such mechanism was in place to keep track of the privatised units.

 

Answer to another question raised through the RTI request was also denied being secret information. It had asked about the number of privatised units still operational. However, the senator was given a reply.

 

It is another story that the concerned officials collected information for the senator using internet search engines to determine if the sold units had any website available as the reply submitted to the Senate marked red around 16 privatised units with the citation “website not exist.”

 

This correspondent made an RTI request following reports about the Javedan Cement Limited that was privatised on throwaway prices in 2006 on the condition that the sick industrial unit would be revived and a power plant of 100 MW electricity be installed but neither was done. Instead, it was altogether abolished and replaced with the Naya Nazimabad Housing Society, designed by converting industrial lease into residential allegedly in connivance with the revenue authorities.

 

The housing project for affluent class, built on the Javedan Cement’s industrial land, is situated next to a factory dumping site that, according to an environmental study conducted on the order of the Supreme Court, has air-borne cancer-causing chemicals exposing the surrounding population to fatal risks.

 

Interestingly, the name of Javedan Cement Company is among the list of still-functional privatised units in the reply that the Privatisation Commission submitted to the Senate that is contrary to the ground reality.

 

Not only the Privatisation Commission has distorted the facts about the post-privatisation mechanism for the privatised public sector entities, the reply to the RTI’s request has been given after a nine-month delay. This is in contrast with the same questions asked by a senator two years ago. It was then answered within two months.

 

This correspondent filed an RTI request on January 13 this year under the Freedom of Information Ordinance 2002, asking five questions from the Privatisation Commission. They were about the number of entities privatised since 1991, the post-privatisation mechanism to oversee the implementation of terms and conditions signed by the buyers, the number of privatised entities still functional, the buyers who violated the agreed conditions and cases wherein the buyers are using the land/entities for other business.

 

The answers to these questions were received on October 23, nine months later. While they listed the names of privatised units, sale price, transfer date and the buyers, answers to the remaining four questions were refused on the ground that the information “cannot be provided as the same has not been notified as public record.”

 

Incidentally, PPP Senator Saeed Ghani asked questions about the privatisation in May 2012 that were somewhat similar to those repeated through an RTI request including the numbers/name of privatised units and post-privatisation mechanism. Both questions were answered unlike this correspondent’s RTI request that was returned with one answer, out of five questions.

 

The government’s apathetic behavior towards the privatised units is apparent from the fact that it is not aware of their present status, let alone having any post-privatisation mechanism to monitor the implementation of the agreed conditions.
