Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Syed Khursheed Shah on Sunday said religion was being used in politics as a cover-up as religion and politics should be kept separate.

 

He called upon the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) to make it clear what the real issue was. He reiterated his party’s stance that no negotiations could be held on the issue of making a new province in Sindh as demanded by the MQM. “All are Sindhis here, including the Urdu-speaking people. No discussion will be held on the division of the province. We are ready to die for the integrity of our motherland but will not allow anybody to divide it,” said the veteran politician of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) while speaking to reporters in Sukkur.

 

He said spreading hatred will harm the country, adding that the PPP supports continuity of the democratic system and supremacy of the Constitution. “We are supporting democracy and not the government,” he said.

 

The MQM observed a black day on Sunday in protest against the “derogatory remarks” made by Khursheed Shah against the “Muhajirs”. However, Shah stressed religion and politics should be kept separate.

 

On October 18, Shah hadsaid that Urdu-speaking people of Pakistan were now permanent residents and should therefore stop calling themselves ‘Muhajirs’. “The word ‘Muhajir’ is a ‘gaali’ (curse) for me and I urge our friends to please stop referring themselves as Muhajirs,” he had said.

 

The PPP leader said all Urdu-speaking people are his brothers. “We Sindhis will not let anyone spread hatred on ethnic lines,” he added.

 

Speaking about the blasphemy charges levelled against him, Shah said several conspiracies had been hatched against him in the past as well. “Despite all these nefarious schemes against me, voters have elected me eight times and I have an important role to play in the politics of the country,” he stated.

 

On the appeal of the MQM chief Altaf Hussain, businesses and petrol pumps in some areas of Karachi, Hyderabad and other parts of Sindh were closed down.Little to no transport was seen on the roads. Entry tests scheduled to be held on Sunday at the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology, Jamshoro, were also cancelled. Rangers and police were deployed in the area to maintain law and order.

 

Meanwhile, former PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel said that Shah’s statement was misunderstood and despite having issued an apology, the MQM was exploiting it.“The word ‘Muhajir’ is sacred and respected for me,” Patel said, questioning why the MQM had removed it from their party’s name and changed it to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement instead.

 

Addressing the media in Karachi, Patel said, “In politics, there is a trend to exchange harsh words.”Referring to the blasphemy charges levelled against Shah by the MQM leaders, Patel said religion should be kept out of politics. Further, he criticised the MQM for ‘shutting off’ news channels in parts of Karachi on Saturday.“To cover their news conferences held last night and their rally today, they made you forcibly shut the transmission.”
