The Parliamentary Committee has agreed to meet lawyers� leaders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to know their grievances about the recommendations by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan for appointment of judges in the Peshawar High Court.

 

�The committee headed by Farooq H Naik has agreed to meet the Peshawar High Court Bar Association leaders before examining the Judicial Commission recommendations,� Peshawar High Court Bar Association (PHCBA) President Muhammad Essa Khan told The News on Sunday.

 

He said the PHCBA office-bearers and presidents or general secretaries of bar associations across the province would meet the Parliamentary Committee members before holding their meeting on October 29.

 

The PHCBA has launched the �Save Judiciary Movement� for bringing transparency in the appointment of PHC judges since October 17.

 

The lawyers bodies from across the province on Thursday held a joint meeting at the PHC bar room and decided to provide evidence to the Parliamentary Committee that those recommended for appointment as judges were class fellows and chamber fellows of the PHC chief justice and chief justice of Supreme Court. It has been arguing that these appointments were not made on merit.

 

The PHCBA president said the Provincial Lawyers Convention on the issue would also be held within a few days. He said the bar associations had agreed to hoist black flags on the premises of bar rooms and organize protest camps outside the premises of the courts in every district and tehsil of the province.

 

The PHCBA president warned that if the nomination of the lawyers recommended for appointment as PHC judges were not withdrawn, they would announce complete strike on their oath-taking day from courts and start protest from the PHC for an indefinite period.

 

Some legal experts said it was a valid ground for the federal government to take up the matter of recommended judges with the Judicial Commission as the lawyers are protesting against the nomination of the judges on the basis of favoritism.

 

They said that a few months ago, the federal government had also realized the issue and even started efforts to increase the powers of the Parliamentary Committee and decrease those of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan after amending Article 175-A of the Constitution.

 

In this regard, a special committee of the Senate had also held its meeting with the PPP Senator and ex-law minister Farooq H Naek in the chair, and sought recommendations from the Supreme Court Bar Association President Kamran Murtaza and Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Syed Qalb-e-Hassan.

 

The special committee, comprising Rafique Rajwana, Farooq H Naik and MNA Muhammad Bashir Virk, was tasked on January 4 to obtain recommendations from lawyers� bodies, senior advocates and parliamentarians on the dispute of powers among the Parliamentary Committee and the Judicial Commission.

 

One of the members of Parliamentary Committee said the proposed amendment in the article would strengthen the viewpoint of the members of the Parliamentary Committee in the appointment of judges. He said a proposal was being considered to give more powers to the head of the Parliamentary Committee compared to the head of Judicial Commission after amending the Constitution.

 

He added that after an amendment in Article 175-A, the committee would have powers to reject or uphold recommendations by the Judicial Commission if it thinks a nominated lawyer is not suitable for appointment as a judge.

 

PHCBA secretary general Muhammad Ayaz told The News that the chief justices of high courts and the apex court have the right to initiate the name of a lawyer for appointment as a judge and this blocks the rights of other commission members.

 

He said a retired judge of the apex court should not sit in the judicial commission meetings as a member because he would favour the nomination of the chief justice to whom he is obliged.It may be added that the Judicial Commission and the Parliamentary Committee were formed by amending Article 175-A through 18th and 19th amendments for the appointment of superior court judges.
