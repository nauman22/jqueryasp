ISLAMABAD: Frustrated by the miserable performance of the Pakistan polio programme, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative Saturday recommended that the Prime Minister and Cabinet of Pakistan hand over charge of the country’s polio programme to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) with immediate effect.”

 

“The government needs to be bold and decisive now and rescue Pakistan’s vulnerable children by placing its polio programme in the hands of NDMA,” recommends the 10th report that follows the 11th meeting of the IMB, an impartial international body that assesses global progress in the interruption of poliovirus transmission. The IMB met in London from September 30 to October 2, 2014.

 

The report offers a frank and honest appraisal of the polio programme in Pakistan, making it totally unpalatable for those who have dragged Pakistan to a scenario where the IMB experiences no inhibition in saying that “If Pakistan had matched India’s performance of ridding its country of polio, only 35 people would have been paralysed by polio in the world this year.”

 

Released on Saturday, the report describes Pakistan as “polio’s comfort zone,” its polio programme “a disaster,” and its belatedly-constituted Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) “a masterpiece of obscurity.” What greater embarrassment could the managers of the country’s polio programme have earned?

 

The IMB has also hinted at possibility of further tightening of travel restrictions. It has hoped that the International Regulations Committee, which is meeting next week, will consider recommending that all countries introduce a requirement whereby travelers from polio-infected countries should have to produce a valid vaccination certificate or face the consequence of “being turned away.”

 

There is currently no recommendation for countries that receive travelers. In most places, nobody checks if travelers actually have a vaccination certificate. Should the International Regulations Committee make a recommendation to this effect, countries receiving travelers will have the power to deport those who do not possess valid vaccination certificates.

 

In proposing a solution to Pakistan’s polio predicament, the IMB is convinced that while the government can turn the polio situation around through a determined effort led by NDMA, it also faces the risk of being polio virus’ last home on earth if the programme continues as it is. From the way the programme is being managed, there are little reasons to believe that the initiative will be handed over to NDMA, or that real transformative action will be taken.

 

The IMB believes that the National Disaster Management Act 2010 gives NDMA a clear legislative base and the power needed to throw out polio from its last global stronghold. The NDMA, it feels, is well placed to achieve the level of political commitment that is currently lacking in the programme. “The NDMA can do ‘command and control’. It can work with the military and with the provinces. This is exactly what the polio programme needs,” says the report.

 

Dubbing Pakistan’s Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) “a masterpiece of obscurity,” the IMB states that an emergency response needs ‘command and control’ ability while Pakistan’s EOC is “bureaucratic and confusing.” In May 2014, the IMB recommended that Pakistan establish an EOC by July 1, 2014, building on the experiences of Nigeria. “It speaks volumes about the inertia of the programme in Pakistan that this did not happen by the July 2014 deadline, and that the plan eventually put forward was a pale imitation of its vibrant Nigerian counterpart,” the report states, putting the polio programme to shame.

 

Nigeria’s EOC has been characterised by clear and powerful leadership. “The leadership of Pakistan’s EOC is neither clear nor powerful. If the Pakistan polio virus could read organograms, it would be reveling in its good fortune,” the report states on a satirical note.

 

The IMB has recommended that a well-designed EOC should now be part of NDMA’s infrastructure, providing technical expertise and support. “If there is delay in adopting the NDMA recommendation, the EOC should be strengthened to have the capacity and power that they need to run a programme truly set on eradication,” the report states. Now this recommendation will be music to the ears of polio managers. After all, who can afford the most lucrative health programme being handed over to NDMA?

 

The report recommends that a special meeting of the IMB be held in Pakistan in early 2015. From a global lens, it also recommends the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization now become a sixth core partner in the polio programme to bring a routine immunization focus to the programme’s heart.

 

The report minces no words in establishing why polio has gone out of control in Pakistan. It blames worsening vaccination coverage for leading to decreasing immunity and an explosion in cases. Less than a quarter of vaccination campaigns assessed in the last 12 months have met the required standard of 80% coverage, the report reveals.

 

The IMB leaves no room for Pakistan to seek refuge behind the pretext of inaccessibility. “Inaccessibility in North Waziristan is no longer a valid excuse; insecurity also cannot explain the polio cases that have occurred in Punjab; or excuse those that have been made in numerous districts of Karachi,” it states.

 

The IMB believes that the government of Pakistan can reach its children, “if it wants to,” and that the clear out of North Waziristan is a double-edged sword because it has potentially dispersed the virus over a wide area. “The programme has struck an important blow, but so might the virus,” it warns.

 

The IMB blames the Pakistan government for dismantling the polio programme’s infrastructure a full 17 months ago. “Effective leadership arrangements have been missing in Pakistan for nearly two years,” it states.

 

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s 2013-18 Strategic Plan targeted global interruption of wild poliovirus transmission by end-2014. With less than 10 weeks to go now, this global target will not be achieved, primarily because of Pakistan’s dismal performance.

 

Data embedded in the report provides ample evidence of why Pakistan is solely to blame. Four-fifths of all people in the world paralysed by polio in 2014 are in Pakistan; five of six cases in Afghanistan were caused by Pakistan poliovirus; 38 children in Syria and Iraq were paralysed as the Pakistan polio virus surged into these countries. Between July and September 2014, eight times as many children were paralysed in Pakistan than everywhere else put together.

 

The report goes on to highlight that every single province in Pakistan is infected, with polio striking at will. In Punjab, for instance, poliovirus has been circulating in a metro like Lahore for six months, clearly demonstrating deteriorating accountability and oversight. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has had 31 children paralysed by polio in 2014, the innovative one-day security cordoned campaigns have not been continued or properly scaled up throughout the province. Karachi, the report says, will need a decisive strategy. Quetta, it says, is home to the world’s longest missed chain of polio transmission, showing up terrible surveillance.

 

The IMB blames Pakistan for putting the entire global goal in jeopardy. “Something big has to change in Pakistan; nothing short of bold, transformative action will bring this Marie Celeste of a programme to life,” the report states. Could there have been a bigger assault on Pakistan’s dwindling credibility to end polio? Certainly not!
